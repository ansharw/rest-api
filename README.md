# Flat Architecture Golang 

In the context of software development in the Go programming language, "flat architecture" typically refers to a design pattern where the codebase is organized in a relatively simple and shallow hierarchy. In a flat architecture, there are fewer layers or levels of abstraction, and the components of the application are often organized more horizontally rather than vertically. This can make the codebase easier to understand and maintain, especially for smaller projects or when simplicity is a priority.

## Rules of flat (comming soon)

- **Simplicity:** Simplicity is easy to understand, uncomplicated, or not complex.

### Quickstart

Do you want to test API in local, you need to run docker compose to setup the container early. 
```shell
docker compose up
```

#### Rest API is running locally

Since docker running, we have to execute the golang code. 
```shell
go run main.go
```
